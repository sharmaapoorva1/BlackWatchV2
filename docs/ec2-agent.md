# EC2 host agent — full reference

The canonical document for everything on the BlackWatch EC2 reporter agent:
what it does, where it lives, how to install/upgrade it, what it protects
against, and how to verify it's working.

The quick-start install is at [`deploy/ec2/README.md`](../deploy/ec2/README.md);
read this when you want the *full* picture or are debugging at 3am.

Current agent version: **v1.6** (delivery metadata, hardened, full File Integrity Monitoring).

Recent version history:
- **v1.2** — scrubbing, systemd sandbox, watchdog, size caps, send backoff
- **v1.3** — FIM Part 1: periodic baseline scan + per-instance coverage
- **v1.4** — FIM Part 2: real-time inotify watcher on critical paths
- **v1.5** — FIM Part 3: auditd whodata, actor attribution per change event
- **v1.6** — stable report identity, sequence tracking, and server-side delivery timing

For a deep dive on FIM specifically (architecture, every detection path,
auditd rules, the UI surfaces, troubleshooting), see [`docs/fim.md`](fim.md).
This file remains the canonical reference for the agent as a whole.

---

## 1. What it does

Runs as a systemd service on every EC2 we want monitored. Every `INTERVAL`
seconds (default 60s) it:

1. Reads recent `sshd` + `sudo` lines from `journalctl`.
2. Runs whichever collectors are *due* (each has its own cadence — fast
   ones every minute, FIM-tier every 2 min, heavy ones every 10 min).
3. Samples always-on lightweight metrics (memory, CPU, sessions, OOM,
   rpm-DB health).
4. Drains any pending **FIM** change events queued by the FIM engine's
   three detection threads (periodic baseline / inotify / auditd whodata).
5. Builds **one JSON payload** and pushes it to an SQS queue using the
   instance role (no static creds on the box).
6. Spools to disk and replays if SQS is unreachable. Bounded — see
   [Failure modes](#13-failure-modes--recovery).

Each report also carries `agent_id`, `boot_id`, a monotonic `sequence`, a
`report_id`, `collected_at`, and `sent_at`. BlackWatch records when the report
was accepted and processed separately, so queue delay and ingest delay are
visible without treating either as agent downtime.

In parallel, three background threads owned by `fim_engine.py` run
independently of the heartbeat tick:
- **Periodic baseline scanner** — every 6h, hashes ~3000 files, diffs
  against the local SQLite baseline, queues any changes.
- **Inotify watcher** — sub-second detection on critical paths (sudoers,
  sshd_config, authorized_keys, cron, systemd units, etc).
- **Audit reader** — tails `/var/log/audit/audit.log` with key `bw_fim`,
  maintains a path → `{uid,pid,comm,exe,proctitle}` lookup map. The other
  two threads consult it when emitting changes, attaching actor data.

BlackWatch (running on Lightsail) drains the SQS queue and turns each
payload into normalized events. FIM changes get persisted to
`fim_history` + `fim_baselines`; coverage stats land in `fim_coverage`
and feed the `/fim` UI.

```

Agents PUSH outbound to SQS (no inbound port open on the EC2). This is
critical for internal-only boxes — they need full egress to reach SQS,
but no inbound from the public internet ever.

## 3. Files & paths

### On the EC2 box (set up by `install-agent.sh`)

| Path | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/opt/blackwatch/ec2_agent.py` | `0755 root:root` | The agent script itself. Not a secret. |
| `/opt/blackwatch/fim_engine.py` | `0644 root:root` | FIM engine module (v1.3+). Imported by `ec2_agent.py` at startup. |
| `/etc/systemd/system/blackwatch-agent.service` | `0644 root:root` | systemd unit. Owns all env vars + sandboxing. |
| `/etc/sysctl.d/99-blackwatch-agent.conf` | `0644 root:root` | Bumps `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` for FIM Part 2. |
| `/etc/audit/rules.d/bw_fim.rules` | `0640 root:root` | Audit rules for FIM Part 3 whodata. Loaded by auditd. |
| `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent/` | `0700 root:root` | Spool parent. Locked at install time. |
| `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent/spool/` | `0700 root:root` | Created on first send failure. Files are `0600`. |

| `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent/fim/` | `0700 root:root` | FIM state directory. |
| `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent/fim/baseline.db` | `0600 root:root` | SQLite (WAL) holding per-path hash + metadata. Shared by all three FIM threads. |
| systemd journal (`journalctl -u blackwatch-agent`) | n/a | All agent stdout/stderr lands here. |

### In the BlackWatch repo

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/ec2_agent.py` | Source-of-truth for the agent. Pushed to each EC2's `/opt/blackwatch/`. |
| `scripts/fim_engine.py` | FIM engine — periodic + inotify + auditd threads. Pushed alongside `ec2_agent.py`. |
| `deploy/ec2/install-agent.sh` | Idempotent installer. Sets up systemd unit, sysctl, audit rules. |
| `deploy/ec2/setup.ps1` | One-time AWS bootstrap (creates SQS queue, IAM policies). |
| `deploy/ec2/blackwatch-ec2-agent-send-policy.json` | Minimal IAM policy: `sqs:SendMessage` to the one queue. |
| `deploy/ec2/README.md` | Quick-start (5 min). |
| `blackwatch/modules/ec2_host.py` | Adapter that converts the JSON payload into BlackWatch Events (incl. `host.fim.*`). |
| `blackwatch/hosts/projection.py` | Stateful read-model — last-seen, staleness, snapshot diffs, FIM baseline + history + coverage. |
| `blackwatch/hosts/diff.py` | Snapshot diffing — what changed since last snapshot. |
| `blackwatch/connectors/aws_sqs.py` | Generic SQS poller. `target_module=ec2.host` routes to the adapter. |
| `blackwatch/sql/014_fim.sql`, `015_fim_inotify.sql`, `016_fim_whodata.sql`, `017_fim_path_stats.sql` | FIM read-model migrations. Additive — apply in order. |
| `docs/ec2-agent.md` | **This file** — the agent overall. |
| `docs/fim.md` | The deep-dive FIM reference. |

---

## 4. Configuration (environment variables)

All set in the systemd unit's `Environment=` lines (read at startup; restart
the unit to apply changes).

### Required

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BLACKWATCH_SQS_URL` | `https://sqs.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/095899260107/blackwatch-ec2-agents` | The queue. Validated by regex at startup — refuses bad shapes. |

### Common overrides

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_REGION` | from IMDS | SQS queue region. Almost always same as the instance. |
| `INTERVAL` | `60` | Tick interval in seconds. Also drives the `auth_events` lookback (`INTERVAL + 120`). |
| `BLACKWATCH_TAGS` | `""` | `k=v,k=v` pairs stamped onto every event's extras. E.g. `env=prod,role=api`. Used for routing rules. |
| `SPOOL_DIR` | `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent` | Parent of `spool/`. |
| `SPOOL_MAX_FILES` | `5000` | Hard cap. Oldest files deleted when exceeded. |
| `SPOOL_MAX_BYTES` | `100*1024*1024` (100 MB) | Hard byte cap. Oldest files deleted when exceeded. |

### FIM (Part 1 / 2 / 3)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `COLLECT_FIM_SEC` | `21600` (6h) | Periodic baseline scan interval. Lower = faster drift detection + more CPU at scan time. |
| `BLACKWATCH_FIM_DISABLED` | `""` (off) | Set to `1` / `true` / `yes` to disable FIM entirely. The agent still ships heartbeat + auth + snapshots; FIM threads don't start. |
| `BLACKWATCH_FIM_EXTRA_FILES` | `""` | Comma-separated paths to ADD to the per-file FIM watch (e.g. `/etc/redis/redis.conf,/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf`). Merged with defaults. |
| `BLACKWATCH_FIM_EXTRA_DIRS` | `""` | Comma-separated dirs to ADD to the recursive FIM watch (e.g. `/etc/nginx,/etc/letsencrypt`). |

### Per-collector cadence (only override if you know why)

| Variable | Default (sec) | Collector |
|---|---|---|
| `COLLECT_PORTS_SEC` | 60 | listening sockets |
| `COLLECT_PROCESSES_SEC` | 60 | process table (visibility-only, non-diffable) |
| `COLLECT_DISK_SEC` | 60 | per-mount fill |
| `COLLECT_USERS_SEC` | 120 | `getent passwd` |
| `COLLECT_AUTHORIZED_KEYS_SEC` | 120 | `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` per user |
| `COLLECT_SUDOERS_SEC` | 120 | `/etc/sudoers` + `/etc/sudoers.d/*` hashes |
| `COLLECT_CRITICAL_FILES_SEC` | 120 | FIM on `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `sshd_config`, etc. |
| `COLLECT_CRON_SEC` | 120 | `/etc/cron.*`, `/var/spool/cron` |
| `COLLECT_PACKAGES_SEC` | 600 | `rpm -qa` or `dpkg-query` |
| `COLLECT_SYSTEMD_UNITS_SEC` | 600 | enabled service+timer units |
| `COLLECT_SUID_SEC` | 600 | `find / -perm -4000` (scoped) |
| `COLLECT_KERNEL_MODULES_SEC` | 600 | `lsmod` |

---

## 5. What gets collected

### Collectors (cadence-driven, diff against last snapshot)

| Collector | Cadence | Diffable | What it captures |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ports` | 60s | ✓ | `ss -tlnp` — proto, addr, port, binding process |
| `processes` | 60s | ✗ | `ps -eo user,pid,comm,args` — args truncated to 240 chars, **scrubbed** |
| `disk` | 60s | ✓ | `df -PT` — per-mount fill, skips tmpfs/devtmpfs/overlay |
| `users` | 120s | ✓ | `getent passwd` — name, uid, shell |
| `authorized_keys` | 120s | ✓ | Per-user keys → `{user, fingerprint, type}`. **No pubkey body, no comment.** |
| `sudoers` | 120s | ✓ | SHA256 of `/etc/sudoers` + each `/etc/sudoers.d/*` |
| `critical_files` | 120s | ✓ | SHA256 of `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `sshd_config`, `hosts`, `resolv.conf`, `pam.d/{sshd,sudo,openvpn}`, `crontab` |
| `cron` | 120s | ✓ | SHA256 of `/etc/crontab`, `/etc/cron.{d,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}/*`, `/var/spool/cron/*` |
| `packages` | 600s | ✓ | Sorted set of installed package names (RPM or DPKG, auto-detected) |
| `systemd_units` | 600s | ✓ | Sorted set of enabled `.service` + `.timer` units |
| `suid` | 600s | ✓ | `find /usr /opt /bin /sbin -xdev -perm -4000 -type f` |
| `kernel_modules` | 600s | ✓ | Sorted set of loaded modules from `lsmod` |

**Snapshots only ship when something changed** (hash of all diffable
collectors). Forced full resync every 1 hour even if unchanged.

### Always-on heartbeat fields (every tick)

| Field | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `memory` | `/proc/meminfo` | total/available/used kB + used % |
| `cpu` | `/proc/loadavg` + `/proc/cpuinfo` | 1/5/15-min load, CPU count, load normalized by CPU count |
| `active_sessions` | `who --ips` (fallback `who`) | currently logged-in interactive sessions, with source IP for SSH |
| `oom_events` | `journalctl -k` | OOM-killer entries from kernel ring buffer |
| `rpm_db_corrupted` | `/var/lib/rpm/__db.*` + `pgrep` | Stale lock files w/o live rpm process → DB stuck |
| `stalled_collectors` | derived | Collectors that succeeded once but not within `3 * interval` |
| `collector_errors` | derived | Last error per failing collector |
| `tick_duration_ms` | timer | How long this tick took. Watchdog signal. |

### Journal events (sshd + sudo)

Read every tick with overlap window `INTERVAL + 120s`. Deterministic
event IDs via journal `__CURSOR` → dedup at insert.

**`MESSAGE` field is scrubbed before shipping** (see [scrubber](#84-secret-scrubbing-patterns)).
`__CURSOR` and `__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP` are preserved so dedup still works.

---

## 6. Events emitted (BlackWatch-side)

The `Ec2HostAdapter` converts each payload into one or more normalized
events. Action names you'll see in `/events`:

| Action | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `host.service.health` | every heartbeat | Drives `host_status` read model. Always emitted. |
| `host.state.snapshot` | when snapshots shipped | Diff is computed in projection. Capped at 512 KB body. |
| `host.state.snapshot.rejected` | snapshot > 512 KB | Synthetic event so operator sees something went wrong instead of silently dropping. |
| `host.auth.ssh.success` | `Accepted publickey for ec2-user from …` | One per match. `actor.principal=user`, `actor.source_ip=ip`. |
| `host.auth.ssh.failure` | `Failed publickey for …` OR `Invalid user …` | Includes `extra.reason=invalid_user` for the latter. |
| `host.sudo.exec` | `sudo: user : COMMAND=...` | `extra.command` populated (scrubbed). |
| `host.sudo.failure` | `authentication failure`, `NOT in the sudoers`, etc. | |
| `host.oom_kill` | matched kernel OOM message | Includes truncated kernel message. Severity `failure`. |

Diff-derived events (emitted by `hosts/projection.py`, not the adapter):

| Action | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `host.authorized_key.added` / `removed` | diff between snapshots |
| `host.user.added` / `removed` | diff in `users` collector |
| `host.sudoers.changed` | sudoers hash change |
| `host.port.opened` / `closed` | diff in `ports` collector |
| `host.suid.added` / `removed` | diff in SUID set |
| `host.cron.added` / `removed` / `changed` | diff in cron files |
| `host.file.changed` | critical_files hash change |
| `host.service.added` / `removed` | diff in systemd units |
| `host.packages.changed` | diff in package set |
| `host.agent.stale` | no heartbeat in 3× interval |
| `host.agent.recovered` | heartbeat returns after staleness |
| `host.collector.stalled` | individual collector hasn't succeeded in 3× its interval |

FIM events (emitted by the new `fim_engine.py` threads):

| Action | Trigger | Severity (default) |
|---|---|---|
| `host.fim.created` | new file appeared in a watched path | low |
| `host.fim.modified` | content changed (sha256 differs) | medium · upgraded by per-path rules for sudoers / sshd_config / etc. |
| `host.fim.deleted` | watched file removed | low |
| `host.fim.perm_changed` | mode bits changed | medium |
| `host.fim.owner_changed` | uid/gid changed | medium |
| `host.fim.coverage` | per-heartbeat coverage stats | n/a — projection-only, never stored |

Every FIM event carries `extra.detection ∈ {baseline, inotify, auditd}` plus
(when audit caught it) `extra.actor = {uid, gid, pid, comm, exe, proctitle}`.
See [`docs/fim.md`](fim.md) for the full event shape, all detection rules,
and the UI surfaces (`/fim`, `/fim/<id>`).

---

## 7. IAM (the only AWS permission the agent needs)

`deploy/ec2/blackwatch-ec2-agent-send-policy.json`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "BlackWatchAgentSendToQueue",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:blackwatch-ec2-agents"
    }
  ]
}
```

That's it. The agent can:
- Send messages to ONE specific queue.

It cannot:
- Read from the queue
- Delete messages
- List queues
- Touch S3, IAM, EC2, anything else

Attach this policy to each EC2's instance role. If the role is missing or
unattached, every `SendMessage` returns `AccessDenied` — the agent
spools, backs off, and reports loudly in the journal. The install
script's preflight (`aws sts get-caller-identity` + `sqs
get-queue-attributes`) catches this at install time.

---

## 8. Security model (the hardening)

### 8.1 Privilege model

The agent runs as **root**. Non-negotiable — it must:

- Read `/etc/shadow` (FIM)
- Read journald (any UID is fine if in `systemd-journal` group, but
  shadow forces root)
- Run `find` across `/usr /opt /bin /sbin` for SUID detection
- Read `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`

Since we can't drop privileges, we sandbox aggressively instead.

### 8.2 systemd sandboxing

| Directive | Effect | Min systemd |
|---|---|---|
| `NoNewPrivileges=true` | Can't gain new privs via SUID/setcap binaries | 209 ✓ AL2 |
| `ProtectSystem=full` | `/usr`, `/boot`, `/efi` read-only | 208 ✓ AL2 |
| `ProtectHome=read-only` | `/home` read-only (need read for `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`) | 217 ✓ AL2 |
| `PrivateTmp=true` | Private `/tmp` namespace | 199 ✓ AL2 |
| `PrivateDevices=true` | No raw device access | 209 ✓ AL2 |
| `SystemCallArchitectures=native` | Only this host's syscall ABI | 209 ✓ AL2 |
| `SystemCallFilter=@system-service` | seccomp allowlist; blocks `bpf()`, raw sockets, obscure attack surface | 187 ✓ AL2 |
| `RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX AF_NETLINK` | No raw sockets, no obscure socket families | 211 ✓ AL2 |
| `WatchdogSec=180` | systemd kills + restarts if no `WATCHDOG=1` ping in 3 min | 209 ✓ AL2 |
| **Below: silently ignored on AL2; auto-enable on AL2023 / Ubuntu 22.04** | | |
| `ProtectKernelTunables=true` | `/proc/sys/*` and `/sys/*` read-only | 232 |
| `ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/blackwatch-agent /var/log` | With `ProtectSystem=strict`, only these are writable | 231 |
| `ProtectKernelModules=true` | Block module load/unload | 232 |
| `ProtectControlGroups=true` | `/sys/fs/cgroup` read-only | 232 |
| `ProtectClock=true` | Can't change wall clock | 245 |
| `RestrictNamespaces=true` | Block namespace creation | 233 |
| `RestrictRealtime=true` | No realtime scheduling | 231 |
| `RestrictSUIDSGID=true` | Can't create SUID/SGID files | 242 |
| `LockPersonality=true` | Personality syscall locked | 235 |
| `LogRateLimitIntervalSec=10` / `LogRateLimitBurst=200` | A bug in the agent can't flood journald | 240 |

### 8.3 Resource limits

| Directive | Limit |
|---|---|
| `MemoryLimit=200M` | OOM-killed if exceeded |
| `CPUQuota=20%` | Throttled if exceeded |
| `TasksMax=64` | Process count cap |
| `LimitNOFILE=1024` | Open file descriptor cap |
| `Nice=10` | De-prioritized vs. workloads |

### 8.4 Secret scrubbing patterns

Applied to: process `args`, sudo `COMMAND=...` lines, sshd journal
`MESSAGE` fields. Implemented in `scripts/ec2_agent.py::scrub()`.

| Pattern | Example match | Replaced with |
|---|---|---|
| `mysql -p` flag | `mysql -ppassword` | `mysql -p***` |
| `--password=` / `--passwd=` / `--pass=` | `--password=secret` | `--password=***` |
| `MYSQL_PWD=` / `PGPASSWORD=` | `PGPASSWORD=hunter2` | `PGPASSWORD=***` |
| `--token=` / `--secret=` / `--api-key=` / `--apikey=` / `--key=` | `--token=ABC123` | `--token=***` |
| Uppercase env-assigned secrets | `AWS_SECRET_KEY=xyz` | `AWS_SECRET_KEY=***` |
| AWS access key ID | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` | `AKIA****REDACTED****` |
| `aws_secret_access_key=` | `aws_secret_access_key=xyz...` | `aws_secret_access_key=***` |
| `Authorization: Bearer …` / `Basic …` | `Authorization: Bearer eyJabc.def` | `Authorization: Bearer ***` |

False-positive risk: the broad uppercase pattern catches `LDAP_PASSWORD`,
`MY_API_KEY`, etc. — desired. Doesn't match lowercase generic words.
False-negative known: shell-quoted secrets like `mysql -p "hunter2"`
won't match the `-p` pattern; quoting is rare in real ps output.

### 8.5 Spool permissions

| Path | Mode |
|---|---|
| `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent/` | `0700 root:root` (at install + at spool time) |
| `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent/spool/` | `0700 root:root` |
| `/var/lib/blackwatch-agent/spool/*.json` | `0600 root:root` (created with explicit `os.open(..., 0o600)`, umask-independent) |

Contains: scrubbed journal lines, scrubbed process args, snapshots. Even
post-scrubbing, treat as sensitive — never `chmod` to anything else.

### 8.6 SQS URL allowlist

At startup, `BLACKWATCH_SQS_URL` is regex-checked against:

```
^https://sqs\.[a-z0-9-]+\.amazonaws\.com/\d{12}/[A-Za-z0-9_\-]{1,80}$
```

If it doesn't match, the agent refuses to start. This catches tampered
systemd units that might point at an attacker-controlled queue. The IAM
policy (queue ARN-scoped `SendMessage`) is the real defense; this is a
fail-fast signal so the operator sees the misconfig in seconds, not via
silently-spooled rejected sends.

### 8.7 Payload size cap

SQS message body limit is 256 KiB. The agent reserves 240 KiB headroom
(`SQS_BODY_MAX_BYTES`). Pre-flight check on every send; if oversized,
fields are dropped in priority order until under cap:

1. `snapshots.suid` (huge on package-heavy boxes)
2. `snapshots.systemd_units`
3. `snapshots.packages`
4. `snapshots.kernel_modules`
5. `snapshots.cron`
6. `snapshots.processes`
7. Entire `snapshots` block
8. `auth_events` (last resort — followers replay next tick)

What was dropped is recorded in `payload.truncated: [field1, field2, ...]`
and surfaces in BlackWatch under `extra.adapter_truncated` and as the
`trunc=...` flag in the agent's per-tick journal line.

### 8.8 Send-failure backoff

| Consecutive failures | Extra sleep after spool |
|---|---|
| 1–3 | none (treat as transient) |
| 4–6 | 30 s |
| 7–9 | 60 s |
| 10–12 | 90 s |
| ≥ 13 | 300 s (capped) |

Resets to zero on first successful send. Without this, a permanently
broken URL or revoked IAM would burn the 5000-file spool cap in 2–3
hours.

### 8.9 Watchdog

`Type=notify` + `WatchdogSec=180`. The agent sends `READY=1` at startup
and `WATCHDOG=1` after every tick (`_sd_notify` writes to `$NOTIFY_SOCKET`).
If a collector hangs and a tick fails to complete in 3 min, systemd
SIGKILLs + restarts the agent — and the projection emits
`host.collector.stalled` so the cause shows up in `/iam` /
`/events` rather than as silent agent death.

## 9. Installation

### 9.1 Prerequisites

- Linux EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2, 2023, Debian, Ubuntu — all
  supported). RPM- and DPKG-based families auto-detected.
- `python3 >= 3.7` (AL2's default 3.7 works; pin handles boto3 compat).
- `journald` running.
- Instance role attached, with the `blackwatch-ec2-agent-send` policy
  (Section 7).
- Outbound network access to SQS (`sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com` over
  HTTPS:443). Internal-only EC2s with full egress: works.
- One-time AWS bootstrap done (queue + IAM policy created — see
  `deploy/ec2/setup.ps1`).

### 9.2 Install steps

On your dev machine:

```powershell
$KEY = "<path to .pem>"
$BOX = "ec2-user@<instance-ip>"

scp -i $KEY scripts/ec2_agent.py            ${BOX}:/tmp/
scp -i $KEY deploy/ec2/install-agent.sh     ${BOX}:/tmp/
```

On the EC2 box:

```bash
sudo BLACKWATCH_SQS_URL="https://sqs.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/<ACCT>/blackwatch-ec2-agents" \
     AWS_REGION="us-west-1" \
     INTERVAL="60" \
     BLACKWATCH_TAGS="env=prod,role=api" \
     AGENT_SRC=/tmp/ec2_agent.py \
     bash /tmp/install-agent.sh
```

What the install script does (in order):

1. Validates `BLACKWATCH_SQS_URL` is set.
2. Installs `python3-pip` if missing (yum/dnf/apt-get).
3. `pip3 install 'boto3>=1.28,<1.35'` — pinned to a 3.7-compatible range.
4. `install -d -m 0755 /opt/blackwatch` and `install -d -m 0700 /var/lib/blackwatch-agent`.
5. Copies the agent (skipped if `AGENT_SRC` == installed path).
6. Preflight: `aws sts get-caller-identity` + `aws sqs get-queue-attributes`.
   Warnings only (non-fatal) — catches missing IAM role before you walk
   away.
7. Writes `/etc/systemd/system/blackwatch-agent.service` with the full
   sandboxing + watchdog config.
8. `systemctl daemon-reload` → `systemctl enable` → `systemctl restart`.
9. Prints the first ~8 lines of `systemctl status` for sanity.

### 9.3 Upgrade / reinstall

The script is idempotent. Re-run with a new `AGENT_SRC` and it replaces
the script + rewrites the unit + restarts. **Use `AGENT_SRC=/tmp/...`,
not the installed path** — `install(1)` refuses copy-onto-self
(handled gracefully now: the script detects same-path and skips the
copy, but the rest of the script still runs).

To upgrade ONLY the systemd unit (no code change):

```bash
sudo BLACKWATCH_SQS_URL="..." AWS_REGION="..." \
     AGENT_SRC=/opt/blackwatch/ec2_agent.py \
     bash /tmp/install-agent.sh
```

The "same file" detection skips the copy; the unit is rewritten and the
service restarted.

### 9.4 Uninstall

```bash
sudo systemctl stop blackwatch-agent
sudo systemctl disable blackwatch-agent
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/blackwatch-agent.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm -rf /opt/blackwatch /var/lib/blackwatch-agent
# Optional: detach the IAM policy from the instance role.
```

---

## 10. Operational commands

### Status + logs

```bash
# Current state
sudo systemctl status blackwatch-agent

# Live tail
sudo journalctl -u blackwatch-agent -f

# Recent activity
sudo journalctl -u blackwatch-agent --since "10 min ago" --no-pager

# Just the per-tick summary lines
sudo journalctl -u blackwatch-agent --since "1 hour ago" --no-pager | grep "^reported"
```

### Per-tick log line — field reference

```
reported instance=i-03499c8ce39a70d21 auth_lines=24 snaps=yes tick_ms=268 mem=56% load=0.065 sess=0 rpmdb=BAD
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `instance=...` | EC2 instance ID from IMDS |
| `auth_lines=N` | sshd + sudo lines shipped this tick |
| `snaps=yes` / `no` | Whether the snapshot block was included (only when changed or hourly resync) |
| `tick_ms=N` | How long collectors + send took |
| `mem=X%` | Used memory percentage |
| `load=X` | Normalized 1-min load (1.0 = saturated) |
| `sess=N` | Currently logged-in interactive sessions |
| Optional flags: | |
| `oom=N` | OOM kills detected this tick |
| `rpmdb=BAD` | RPM DB has stale locks |
| `stalled=ports,packages` | Collectors that haven't succeeded in 3× their interval |
| `errs=ports,packages` | Last-run errored (one-off) |
| `trunc=snapshots.suid,...` | Payload size cap kicked in; these fields were dropped |

### Force a tick + exit (debug)

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/blackwatch/ec2_agent.py --once
```

Runs one tick to stdout (still sends to SQS). Useful when systemd-managed
output is hiding something.

### Restart, stop, start

```bash
sudo systemctl restart blackwatch-agent
sudo systemctl stop blackwatch-agent
sudo systemctl start blackwatch-agent
```

### Inspect spool

```bash
sudo ls -la /var/lib/blackwatch-agent/spool/
sudo cat /var/lib/blackwatch-agent/spool/<latest>.json | jq .
```

Spool is FIFO: oldest gets sent first on next flush. Cap enforcement
drops oldest first.

### Trigger spool flush manually (boto3 must be reachable)

```bash
# There's no admin command — the agent flushes on the next successful
# send() call. To force it now, restart:
sudo systemctl restart blackwatch-agent
```

---

## 11. Verifying hardening is active

```bash
# Sandboxing — note systemd 219 (AL2) silently omits properties it
# doesn't recognize from `show`; check the unit file directly if so.
sudo systemctl show blackwatch-agent \
  -p NoNewPrivileges -p ProtectSystem -p ProtectHome \
  -p PrivateTmp -p PrivateDevices \
  -p WatchdogSec -p RestrictAddressFamilies

# Expected on AL2:
#   NoNewPrivileges=yes
#   ProtectSystem=full
#   ProtectHome=read-only
#   PrivateTmp=yes
#   PrivateDevices=yes
#   WatchdogSec=3min   (may be missing from show; check unit file)
#   RestrictAddressFamilies=[unprintable]   (set, display quirk on 219)

# Read directly from the unit file to be sure (these are present in the
# unit file but systemd 219 ignores ProtectKernelTunables and friends —
# they activate automatically on AL2023+):
sudo grep -E "^(WatchdogSec|RestrictAddressFamilies|Type|NotifyAccess)=" \
  /etc/systemd/system/blackwatch-agent.service

# Spool permissions
sudo stat -c "%a %U %G" /var/lib/blackwatch-agent
# 700 root root

# Watchdog is alive — silence means working
sudo journalctl -u blackwatch-agent --since "10 min ago" | grep -i "watchdog timeout" \
  || echo "no watchdog timeouts (good)"
```

### Test scrubbing end-to-end

```bash
# Start a process that lingers long enough to be captured (>= 60s)
sudo bash -c 'sleep 120 --token=SHOULD_BE_REDACTED --password=SECRETPASS' &
```

Wait 90s, then on the BlackWatch host:

```powershell
docker compose exec db psql -U blackwatch -d blackwatch -c "
SELECT envelope->'extra'->'snapshots'->'processes'
FROM events
WHERE module = 'ec2.host' AND action = 'host.state.snapshot'
ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 1;" | Select-String -Pattern 'SHOULD_BE_REDACTED|SECRETPASS|sleep 120'
```

You should see `sleep 120` in the output but NOT the literal secret
strings — they'll appear as `--token=***` and `--password=***`.

### Dedup model

Two layers:

1. **Per-line journal cursor** in event_id (`uuid5(NAMESPACE_URL,
   f"host-auth:{instance_id}:{__CURSOR}")`). Re-reads of overlapping
   `read_auth_events` windows always produce the same event_id →
   `ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING` at insert.
2. **Insert-time gated dispatch** (added in v1.2 of the pipeline):
   notifications fire ONLY when `insert_event()` returned `True` (a new
   row was created). Re-shipped lines don't double-notify.

## 13. Failure modes & recovery

### Common operational failures

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `send failed, spooling: An error occurred (AccessDenied)` repeating | Instance role missing the `blackwatch-ec2-agent-send` policy, or queue ARN mismatch | Attach the policy; verify `aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url $URL` succeeds from the box |
| `send failed: Could not connect to the endpoint URL` | Egress to SQS blocked (security group, NACL, VPC endpoint misconfig) | Allow outbound 443 to `sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com` |
| `ERROR: BLACKWATCH_SQS_URL doesn't look like a valid SQS URL` at startup | Typo in env var or tampered unit | Fix in `/etc/systemd/system/blackwatch-agent.service`, `daemon-reload`, restart |
| `watchdog timeout (limit 3min)` in journal | Agent tick hung >3 min — usually a collector subprocess blocking | systemd auto-restarts; check `collector_errors` and `stalled_collectors` on next ticks |
| `rpmdb=BAD` flag persists across ticks | Stale RPM lock files (`/var/lib/rpm/__db.*`) | `sudo rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__db.*; sudo rpm --rebuilddb` |
| `trunc=snapshots.suid,...` flag every tick | Box is bigger than the SQS body cap | Expected on large boxes; the truncation is recorded. To reduce: raise per-collector intervals, or accept the dropped fields. |
| `stalled=ports,packages` in flag set | A collector errored once and hasn't recovered | Check `collector_errors`, often a missing binary or perms issue. Restart agent if env changed. |
| Spool hits its cap (`Dropped oldest spool file`) | SQS unreachable for hours | Once SQS recovers, the oldest backlog is gone — accepted trade-off for not filling `/var` |
| No `reported` lines but unit is active | Most likely IAM-related; check journal for `AccessDenied` | Same as first row |

### Boot-time recovery

The unit has `Restart=always` + `RestartSec=10`. Any crash (OOM kill,
unhandled exception, watchdog timeout) results in a 10-second restart.
Spool survives — pending payloads are sent on the next successful tick.

### Total data loss scenarios

- Spool dir wiped (`rm -rf /var/lib/blackwatch-agent`) → that backlog
  is gone, agent recreates the dir on next spool.
- EC2 instance terminated → that box's history is gone. No agent
  state on BW survives the box, except whatever events have already
  been received and stored in BW's database.

---

## 14. Known limitations / accepted risk

### Accepted today

| Risk | Mitigation today | Future fix |
|---|---|---|
| Compromised box could spoof events under another `instance_id` | IAM policy on instance roles restricts to ONE queue (single-tenant queue per BW deployment); adapter validates `instance_id` regex but can't verify sender identity from SQS body | Per-instance HMAC signing using a key in SSM Parameter Store; BW-side key store verifies before adapter runs |
| Tampered agent binary at `/opt/blackwatch/ec2_agent.py` not detected | File installed `0755 root:root`; non-root can't modify | Code-signing + signature check at startup |
| boto3 fetched from PyPI at install time | Pin range `>=1.28,<1.35`; reasonably stable | Vendored wheel in `deploy/ec2/` |
| Local journal can be tampered with by root on the box | None — root on the box can do anything | Forwarder to remote journald (rsyslog) for tamper-evident log of last-known-good lines |
| sd_notify not supported on systemd <209 | Doesn't apply to any actively supported distro | n/a |
| Many sandboxing directives no-op on AL2 systemd 219 | Compatibility documented; activate automatically on AL2023+ | Move to AL2023 |

### Out of scope (different feature, not a fix)

- Outbound network connection monitoring (DNS, established TCP) — handled
  by VPC Flow Logs path (planned).
- Per-process syscall auditing — would need auditd integration.
- File integrity at content level (current FIM only hashes a fixed
  whitelist of paths).
- Container introspection (cgroup, namespaces) — agent runs at host
  level only.
