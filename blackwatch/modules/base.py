"""The module/adapter contract — the second frozen interface (after the event
envelope). An adapter is a PURE transform: raw payload -> normalized events.

Rules enforced by convention (keep them true):
  * No side effects. Adapters do not touch the DB, send notifications, or call
    out to AWS. They only transform bytes into Event objects.
  * Transport-agnostic. The transport that delivered the payload is passed in
    via IngestContext as metadata; adapters must not branch core behavior on it.
  * Severity-free. Adapters never set Event.severity — that is a rule decision.
